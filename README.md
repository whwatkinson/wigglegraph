# WiggleGraph

Welcome to Wigglegraph.

## Introduction
1. Why WiggleGraph? My family nickname is Wiggle. The origins of this are a few years back (c. 1995), originally derived from my fathers nickname P-Wig.
In short: P-Wig -> H-Wig -> Wig -> Wiggle

2. I have used [NEO4J](https://neo4j.com/) for a few years I wanted to create a new database. Not as a replacement but rather to increase my understanding of how they work and experience first hand the design deicions made and how the initial ideas can be improved on.
