# WiggleGraph

Welcome to WiggleGraph.

## Introduction
1. Why WiggleGraph? My family nickname is Wiggle. The origins of this are a few years back (c. 1995), originally derived from my fathers nickname P-Wig.
   - In short: P-Wig -> H-Wig -> Wig -> Wiggle
2. I have used [NEO4J](https://neo4j.com/) for a few years I wanted to create a new graph database. Not as a replacement but rather to increase my understanding of how they work and experience first hand the design deicions made and how the initial ideas can be improved on.


## Data structures
- In a Graph database, date is represented as Nodes and Edges.
- This representation makes it easy to express and explore complex relationships between data points.
